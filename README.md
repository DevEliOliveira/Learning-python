In this project I'm going to store what I'm learning about Python

## BMI Calculator

The BMI Calculator is a program that allows you to calculate the Body Mass Index of a person. BMI is a measure used to evaluate if a person is within a healthy weight range based on their height. The program prompts the user to enter their height and weight, and then calculates and displays the corresponding BMI.

## DCN Calculator

The DCN Calculator is a program that assists in determining the Total Daily Energy Expenditure of a person. TDEE represents the number of calories a person needs to consume daily in order to maintain their current weight, taking into account factors such as age, gender, height, weight, and activity level. The program prompts the user to provide information about these factors, and based on that, calculates and displays the corresponding TDEE.

## How to Run this Projects

To run the projects, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the project's directory.
3. For the BMI Calculator, run the following command:
    ```
    python calculate-bmi.py
    ```
4. The program will prompt you to enter your height and weight. Follow the instructions on the screen and provide the required information.
5. The program will calculate your BMI and display the result.

To run the TDEE Calculator, follow steps 2-5 above, replacing `calculate-bmi.py` with `calculate-dcn.py`. The DCN Calculator will prompt you to provide information about your age, gender, height, weight, and activity level, and will calculate and display your TDEE.

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine before running the programs.
